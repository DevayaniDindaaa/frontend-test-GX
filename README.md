# Project Description

This project was developed as part of the frontend technical test for the Fullstack Developer role at GlobalXtreme.

It showcases the ability to build a modern, fully responsive user interface using Nuxt 3 as the main framework and TailwindCSS for styling.

The implementation reflects a fullstack-oriented mindset with attention to component structure, reusability, and frontend best practices.
