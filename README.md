# Project Description

This project was developed as part of the frontend technical test for the Fullstack Developer role.

It demonstrates the ability to build a modern, fully responsive user interface using Nuxt 3 as the main framework and Tailwind CSS for styling.

The implementation reflects a fullstack-oriented mindset with a focus on:

✅ Clean and reusable component structure
✅ Mobile-first and responsive design
✅ Modern UI best practices
✅ Code readability and maintainability
